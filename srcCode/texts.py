            <h3>Welcome</h3>
            <p>
                Welcome to our web application for predicting the photophysical properties of benzothiazole-diazole (BTD) derivatives! 
                This tool is designed to aid researchers and scientists in exploring the optical behavior of BTD compounds, widely recognized 
                for their applications in bioimaging, optoelectronics, and material sciences.
            </p>
            <p>
                By leveraging state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms, the application offers reliable predictions of key properties, 
                such as absorption and emission wavelengths and Stokes shifts. Users can input the SMILE code for a specific BTD derivative 
                or draw the molecule directly on the interface. The model will then process the data and obtain instant results, enabling 
                rapid screening of candidate molecules for various applications.
            </p>

                Benzothiadiazole (BTD) derivatives show promise in advanced photophysical applications, but designing molecules with optimal desired properties remains challenging due to complex structure-property relationships. Existing computational methods have a high cost to predict precise photophysical characteristics. This study employs machine learning with Morgan fingerprints to forecast BTD derivatives' maximum absorption and emission wavelengths. Random forest achieved R2 values of 0.92 for absorption and 0.89 for emission, validated internally with 10-fold cross-validations and externally with experimental datasets. SHAP analysis revealed critical design insights, highlighting tertiary amine presence and solvent polarity as key drivers of red-shifted emissions. By developing a web-based predictive tool, we demonstrate machine learning's potential to accelerate molecular design, providing researchers a powerful approach to engineer BTD derivatives with enhanced photophysical properties.
